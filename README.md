Here’s the explanation you can put in the README.md file of your GitHub repository to explain the requirements.txt file and how to install the dependencies:

Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required Python dependencies. These dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Before installing the dependencies, it’s a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's packages from your global Python environment.

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
2. Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is activated (or if you are using your default environment), run the following command to install all the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file, such as:

numpy
scikit-learn
torch
opencv-python
matplotlib
These libraries are required for running the masked face detection model and related tasks.

3. Deactivating the Virtual Environment
After working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment using the command:

bash
Copy code
deactivate
