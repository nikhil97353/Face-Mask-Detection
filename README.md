# Face-Mask-Detection
To run this project, you need to install the required Python dependencies. These dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Before installing the dependencies, itâ€™s a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's packages from your global Python environment.

python -m venv venv



On Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is activated (or if you are using your default environment), run the following command to install all the dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Deactivating the Virtual Environment
After working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment using the command:
deactivate
